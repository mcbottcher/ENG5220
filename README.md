# Learning glove
## Realtime Embedded project 5

This project proposes to build a wearable glove that can learn hand movements and produce speech from the movements of the hand.

Proposed hardware:
* Sensors on fingers.
* RaspberryPi to read movements and produce sounds.

Proposed software:
* Neural network to classify hand movement inputs.
* Button interface to switch between learning and predicting mode
* Tk/Qt interface?
